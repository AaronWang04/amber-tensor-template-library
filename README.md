# amber - tensor template library in c++
Attempt at an tensor (autograd in future?) library made in C++/Cuda with no external dependencies. The aim of this project is to showcase the use of templating (more specifically, template metaprogramming) to achieve efficiency.

The code and documentation from https://github.com/flashlight/flashlight and https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor helped a lot with my learning!
